# Rensource

Boilerplate for your perfect front-end environment (utilizing Gulp.js, Babel, and more)

## Requirements

The only requirement needed is Node.js & gulp installed. The rest is up to the neat `npm install` command later.

## Getting Started

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:kreativgebiet/rensource-website.git
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install or yarn install
```

### Run

`npm start` to start the server.

Additional you have to run `gulp` to compile style & javascript changes.
